### First Comment (Maker's Story)
```
Hi Product Hunt! 👋

I built TailorMyJob because I was frustrated with the resume optimization process. Every time I applied for a job, I spent hours tweaking my resume, never knowing if it would pass ATS systems or catch a recruiter's eye.

So I built an AI-powered solution using Claude 3.5 Sonnet that:
✅ Analyzes your resume against specific job descriptions
✅ Gives you an ATS compatibility score
✅ Provides actionable improvement suggestions
✅ Works in both English and Traditional Chinese

The whole analysis takes about 60 seconds.

I'd love your feedback! What features would make this more useful for your job search?
