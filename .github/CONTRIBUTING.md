## 📝 Documentation Style Guide

### Writing Style

- **Clear and Concise**: Use simple language
- **Active Voice**: "Upload your resume" not "Resume should be uploaded"
- **Present Tense**: "The system analyzes..." not "The system will analyze..."
- **Second Person**: Address users as "you"
- **Inclusive Language**: Use gender-neutral language

### Formatting

**Headers:**
```markdown
# H1 - Page Title (one per page)
## H2 - Major Sections
### H3 - Subsections
#### H4 - Minor Points
```

**Lists:**
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Use `1.` for ordered lists
- Keep items parallel in structure

**Code:**
- Use ` for inline code
- Use ``` for code blocks
- Specify language for syntax highlighting

**Links:**
- Use descriptive link text
- Check all links work
- Use relative links for internal docs

**Images:**
- Add alt text for accessibility
- Keep file size reasonable
- Use descriptive filenames

### Examples

**Good:**
```markdown
## Upload Your Resume

To upload your resume:

1. Click the "Upload" button
2. Select your file (PDF, DOC, or DOCX)
3. Wait for validation to complete

The system supports files up to 10 MB.
```

**Avoid:**
```markdown
## Resume Upload

You can upload resume by clicking upload and then select file.
PDF DOC DOCX supported, 10MB max.
```
